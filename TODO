API Ideas
---------

All endpoints return JSON, and will start off being read-only.  The endpoints
that are marked as "paged" return 100 items at a time maximum, but this can
be adjusted using "limit" and "offset" parameters.  Requests should be GET.
A "limit" of -1 means no limit.  Offset can only be specified with a limit.
