	<h1>Source Code</h1>

	<p>Sockso uses loads of brilliant source code and free libraries
	that you can find linked to on the right of the page.  Without lots of other
	peoples hard work this project would have been too much, but with the freedom
	of the open source community, and the help of others, we can make great things!</p>
	
	<p>I'm using <a href="http://github.com">Github</a> for source control
	with Sockso.  You can get a copy of sockso using the following command:</p>
	
	<p><pre>git clone https://github.com/rodnaph/sockso.git</pre></p>

        <p>I push my latest changes here pretty often so it should be up to date with
        the latest development.</p>
