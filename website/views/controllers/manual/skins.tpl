switch between the different skins provided, or
<a href="index.php?controller=manual&page=customize">create your own</a>!</p>

<p>The current skin is controlled by the property <b>www.skin</b>.  You can easily
set it from the console by using this command...</p>

<p>Sockso currently ships with the following skins:</p>

<li><b>bold</b> - A high color, bold skin</li>
</ol>

<p>If you do create your own skins please <a href="index.php?controller=contact">send them in</a>
and they'll get included with the next release!</p>
